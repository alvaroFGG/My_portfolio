## Sections
- About
This section is a short introduction about me and my professional career
- Timeline
I made this with the vertical timeline library, here you will see al my studies and professional experience.
- Projects
These are the best projects I made during the frontend development bootcamp, with the links to the github repositories.
- Skills
Inside this section you will see all the technologies that I used during my professional career and the ones that I learned inside the bootcamp.
- Contact
This section pretty small, you only have two buttons:
	-  Email me: it has a mailTo property that opens the mail app in your device with my email in the destination.
	- Download CV: I used S3 service from AWS to upload my cv. It has a public link in order that anyone could see it.

## Functionalities
- Dark mode: It is done with the useContext hook from react
- Smooth Scrolling
- Scroll-up Arrow

## Technologies and Libraries
As I said at the beginning the portfolio is done entirely with React and also I used S3 service from AWS to upload my CV.
- Libraries:
	- Material Icons: for all the icons used in each section.
	- react-vertical-timeline-component: this is the library I used to list all my studies and experience.
